# Pro MERN Stack book notes

## Chapter 2

Notes: 

* The description of the HTML on page 17 is cursory and assumes you know the basics of HTML, but listing 2-1 includes the full HTML necessary to get started. 
* Listing 2-1 has the div id as "contents". It should be "content" to go with the rest of the code described.
* The author often starts talking about code and only later tells you where to put it. This seems to be a deliberate stylistic choice. Keep reading and it should become clear where the code goes (in this case on page 28).
