# Pro MERN Stack book notes

## Chapter 6

Focus is on running MongoDB and using the `mongo` shell.


## Chapter 5

Notes:

* GraphQL queries are very sensitive to correct syntax. Careful of double vs single quotes, be sure to include any "!" etc. specified in the the schema in your query or the request will fail.
* The function shown as `validateIssue(_, { issue })` on the bottom of page 123 and on page 125 is incorrectly named and has the wrong parameters. It should be `issueValidate(issue)` as called at the top of page 126.

## Chapter 4

Notes:


## Chapter 3

Notes:

* Listing 3-6 on page 55 is missing a single quote before "New".

## Chapter 2

Notes:

* The description of the HTML on page 17 is cursory and assumes you know the basics of HTML, but listing 2-1 includes the full HTML necessary to get started.
* Listing 2-1 has the div id as "contents". It should be "content" to go with the rest of the code described.
* The author often starts talking about code and only later tells you where to put it. This seems to be a deliberate stylistic choice. Keep reading and it should become clear where the code goes (in this case on page 28).
